### 🚀 What I'm Currently Building

**Body Control System @ UING** *(July - December 2025)*  
Developing interactive 3D virtual environments using Three.js and WebGL for a gesture-controlled navigation prototype. The system enables natural body movement interaction without VR hardware—designed for defense training, rehabilitation therapy, and digital twin applications.

**My Focus:**
- Architecting immersive 3D scenes optimized for large-format LED displays
- Performance optimization to maintain 60fps with complex 3D environments
- Integrating Three.js frontend with Laravel backend via REST APIs
- Designing intuitive spatial interactions for gesture-based control
