### 🚀 What I'm Currently Building

**Body Control System @ UING** *(July - December 2025)*  
Developing procedural terrain generation system using real-world geospatial data (heightmaps, vegetation) to create interactive 3D simulations of actual geographic locations. Integrated Rapier physics engine with Three.js for realistic terrain interactions, optimized to 55fps while processing gesture control input.

**Technical Focus:**
- Procedural world generation from heightmap and vegetation data
- Real-time terrain customization and editing systems
- Physics integration using Rapier engine
- Performance optimization for complex terrain rendering
